                <h2>The Research.</h2>
                <p>In an effort to incorporate UX principles to our web development course, we conducted five user interviews and administered a survey to 34 participants. The interviews helped us gain a better understanding of our user's painpoints and
                    behaviors. We designed our product based on these findings.</p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>"I started cooking for myself and I feel great." Gemma is an organized and busy young professional. She tries to cook at least 5 times a week becase she feels <strong>healthier knowing what goes into her meals</strong>. She prepares
                            for her meals weekly and has as an <strong>A4 binder with printed recipes clipped in</strong>. Written grocery-list in hand, she shops for her groceries early on Saturday mornings before the store gets busy. She also <strong>googles for inspiration and uses sites
                            like Taste.com</strong>. She hates cooking sites with <strong>too many ads but enjoys ones with community engagement</strong>. Often she browses for recipes while <strong>communting for work and even emails herself</strong>                            the recipes she likes as reminders for later. She finds that her process is currently <strong>time consuming and very manual</strong>. </p>

                        <hr>
                        <p>Nancy is a working mom and has four mouths to please. She <strong>prefers cooking to eating out because she knows what's going into the meals and she can save money</strong>. To change it up, she goes online, usually on <strong>mobile during her commute
                            or at the grocery store</strong>, to look up recipes with <strong>short prep time and good ratings</strong> with the ingredients she has on hand. Food Network or All Recipes are her go-to sites because of the <strong>variety and user ratings</strong>.
                            She loves watching cooking shows to get inspired, especially when cooking for large family gatherings. She's <strong>motivated by cooking dishes that people love but is also easy to make</strong>. Prep and cleaning is painful
                            so she looks for recipes that are
                            <strong>very efficient and provide tips to cut time</strong>. To reuse a recipe she'll either <strong>re-google it or scour messages </strong>from family members. </p>

                        <p>Fatima is glued to her <strong>smartphone</strong>. She loves being a thought leader on social media and often <strong>shares food videos </strong>from sources like TasteMade and Food Network on her Facebook account. This is her
                            way of <strong>connecting with her online
                            community and spreading positivity</strong>. Cooking is an important way to <strong>connect with her daughter</strong>, who wants to be a chef. Experimenting with new and fun recipes is a creative outlet to bring them together.She
                            <strong>cooks to be healthier
                            and likes content that provides context about her food</strong>. However, planning her family's meals can be really hard as it's based on their <strong>tight schedule</strong>. Prepwork is also a pain, so she looks for <strong>easy and fast recipes</strong>                            that require minimal cleanup and shortcuts.</p>
