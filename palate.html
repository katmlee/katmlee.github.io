            <hr>
            <p>Nancy is a working mom and has four mouths to please. She prefers cooking to eating out because she knows what's going into the meals and she can save money. To change it up, she goes online, usually on mobile during her commute or at the grocery store, to look up recipes with short prep time and good ratings with the ingredients she has on hand. Food Network or All Recipes are her go-to sites because of the variety and user ratings.She loves watching cooking shows to get inspired, especially when cooking for large family gatherings. She's motivated by cooking dishes that people love but is also easy to make. Prep and cleaning is painful so she looks for recipes that are very efficient and provide tips to cut time. To reuse a recipe she'll either re-google it or scour messages from family members. </p>
