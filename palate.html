        <h2>The Research</h2>
    <p>In an effort to incorporate UX principles to our web development course, we conducted five user interviews and administered a survey to 34 participants. The interviews helped us gain a better understanding of our user's painpoints and behaviors. We designed our product based on these findings.</p>

            <h4>Gemma, 29 <br> Young Professional</h4>
            <hr>
            <p>"I started cooking for myself and I feel great" Gemma is an organized and busy young professional. She tries to cook at least 5 times a week becase she feels healthier knowing what goes into her meals. She prepares for her meals weekly and has as an A4 binder with printed recipes clipped in. Written grocery-list in hand, she shops for her groceries early on Saturday mornings before the store gets busy. She also browses the internet for inspiration on sites like Taste.com. She hates cooking sites with too many ads but enjoy ones with community engagement. Often she browses for recipes while communting for work and even emails herself the recipes she likes as reminders. She finds that her process is currently time consuming and very manual. </p>
