            The Why.
            <br>
            <br> Travellers want to memoralize and share their travels. How do travellers currently share travels?
            Why do travellers share their travels? To memoralize their experiences, to look cool, to be an "expert", to inspire others. Unless you're a professional blogger, there's not really an easy way to track you travels in a concise way that's easy to share. People trust their peers for recommendations, especially since of similar psychographics and demographics. In my research I found that many people ask their friends via email or messaging platforms for recommendations. Some interviewees even track their travels in spreadsheets. The process is fragmented, duplicative, and time-consuming. That's where Trace comes in. It's an easy way to trace your travels around the world.
